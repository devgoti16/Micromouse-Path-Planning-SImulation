# Micromouse-Path-Planning-SImulation
To make the micromouse robot capable of reaching the centre of the given maze in the shortest possible time using maze solving algorithms.

## Introduction
The maze solving has gained increasing attention in the field of Micromouse competition and Intelligent Robot.
The goal for Micromouse maze solving is to reach the destination cell with minimum cost of resources, such as time and steps. The Micromouse is an automated robot which has to find its way through the arbitrary maze within the least amount of time.
In this simulation, we aim to model the maze layout and obstacles, as well as the robot's sensors and actuators. This simulation will provide valuable insights into the behavior of the robot in a controlled environment and will help us to improve the performance of the actual robot when navigating through a real-world maze.
